// payments API


Payment Process:

    (1) Zomato App:

            Zomato FE (ReactJS)
            
            Zomato BE (NodeJS)


    (2) Payment Gateway - Paytm system


Step 1: Zomato FE will send a payment request to Zomato BE

    /payment:
        req {
            amount: 300,
            email: "abc@def.com",
            mobileNo: "89898989898"
        }


Step 2: Zomato BE will send a response to Zomato FE for the above request

    res: will contain some secure and secret information


Step 3: Zomato FE will take this secret information and go to the Paytm System


Step 4: now user is on the paytm website, user will make the payment
        -> credit card
        -> debit card
        -> netbanking
        -> UPI Id
        -> wallet
        -> food cards


Step 5: User will come back to Zomato FE and Paytm system will inform Zomato BE

    /paymentCallback
        -> success
        -> failure


Step 6: Zomato BE will confirm the payment status again from the Zomato system




//// Paytm Gateway

    -> https://developer.paytm.com/
    -> login with existing paytm account, if not then create an account on paytm and then login
    -> enable the test mode
    -> get the API keys (test API details)
    -> these API keys will be used in Zomato BE, to generate secure information and communicate with the paytm system
    -> in order to use these keys in the Zomato BE
        -> need to create a special file in Zomato BE, known as .env file
        -> copy paste the keys in this file
    -> after this, we need an external library from paytm, to create and read the secure and secret information
        -> https://github.com/paytm/Paytm_Node_Checksum/blob/master/PaytmChecksum.js
        -> download this file and keep it in the Zomato BE controllers folder
    -> Now, we need 5 packages from npmjs.com
        -> dotenv : to read the keys written in .env file
        -> formidable : we will be reading data from the paytm system using this package
        -> uuid : to generate a unique Id for every payment
        -> https : to secure the communication with the paytm system
        -> crypto : required by the PaytmChecksum.js

        > npm i dotenv formidable uuid https crypto --save 

    -> The last thing is to create 2 APIs in the Zomato BE
        -> /payment
        -> /paymentCallback



---> task for learners:

    Create APIs for the following:

        -> saveOrderDetails
            POST request /saveOrderDetails
            {
                items,  // array
                amount, // number
                email,  // string
                mobileNo, // string
                address // string
            }

            -> order controller
            -> order model
            -> order collection in MongoDb

        -> getOrderDetailsByUser
            GET request /getOrderDetailsByUser/:userEmail
            response : for the given email, you will find the orders
